# [Shifty.site](https://shifty.site/?utm_source=github)

An online e-commerce game that challenges the user to overcome frustrating [layout shifts](https://requestmetrics.com/web-performance/cumulative-layout-shift/?utm_source=github) from slow-loading content and grab as many "Deals of the Day" as they can.

The game was built by [Request Metrics](https://requestmetrics.com/?utm_source=github) to educate developers about the Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS) metric, part of Google's Core Web Vitals.

## Usage

The game was built using Typescript, Preact and hosted on Github pages. The build engine runs on NodeJS with Vite. To run locally, you'll need NodeJS ~20.17.0 and install dependencies:

```
npm install
```

Then, to run the game:

```

```

And open http://localhost:4173/
